# New last minute scope-request 4/30/2019 - https://piazza.com/class/jql1e30dxswzu?cid=527

#e.g. the location for it should be
 
# https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cloud/tree/master/cloudmesh/compute/azure

#I propose to rename this provider to 

NativeProvider.py

# to distinguish it from

 
# AzProvider.py .  using az

# Provider.py .     using libcloud

 

# Naturally all student woring on Azure need to be testing all providers not just their own. But that is suposedly simple as the test shoul just be able to be run and the nbenchmark should speeak for itsel.
