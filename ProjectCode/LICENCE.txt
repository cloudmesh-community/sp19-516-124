# To-do
  
  All projects are developed under an open source license, such as the Apache 2.0 License.
  You will be required to add a LICENCE.txt file and describe how other software, if used, 
  can be reused in your project.
  If your project uses different licenses, 
  please add a README.md file that describes which packages are used and what licenses these packages have.
