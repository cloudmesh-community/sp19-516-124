# Google IaaS Cloud Services {#sec:google-products}

Google Cloud, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing
services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and
YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of
modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data
analytics and machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or
bank account details. Pricing is on a pay-as-you-go per second basis,
and discounts are offered for certain services that run for extended
periods. A free trial of $300 worth of services is available for the
first 12 months. Many services are always free up to a certain amount
of use.

Google Cloud Platform provides Infrastructure as a Service, Platform
as a Service, and Server-less Computing environments.

Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the
Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite,
Cloud Identity, Apigee, Firebase, enterprise versions of Android and
Chrome OS, and Google Maps Platform. The platform and all its
offerings can be managed via a customizable dashboard
@fig:gcloud-dashboard.
